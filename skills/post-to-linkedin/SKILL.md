# Post to LinkedIn

## Step 1 — Identify the post file

If a filename was passed as an argument, use it. Otherwise list `/usr/src/app/linkedin/` and ask {{USER}} which file to post. Ignore `style.md`, `old_posts.md`, `DEBUG.md`, and `architecture.md`.

## Step 2 — Read post and style guide

Read the post file and `/usr/src/app/linkedin/style.md` in parallel. The style guide is the source of truth for tone, formatting, and voice — all posts must conform to it.

## Step 3 — Style review and edit

Check the post against the style guide. Fix any violations silently. Then present the full edited post body to {{USER}} exactly as it will be sent to LinkedIn.

## Step 4 — Check for image

If the post references an image file (e.g. a `.png` or `.jpg` in the LinkedIn folder), note the container path: `/projects/hive_mind/linkedin/{filename}`.

**Critical constraint:** Images and videos always render at the **bottom** of the post on LinkedIn, regardless of placement in the text. Warn {{USER}} if the post text references the image in a way that assumes it appears inline — the text should be written so the image at the bottom makes sense.

## Step 5 — Get approval

Ask {{USER}}: "Ready to post?" Do not proceed without explicit confirmation.

## Step 6 — Post

Call `post_to_linkedin` with:
- `content`: the full post text (links can be embedded inline — LinkedIn converts them to shortened links)
- `image_path`: container path to image if one is attached, otherwise omit

## Step 7 — Confirm and archive

Report the post ID on success.

Then move the post file and any associated image/video into an archive folder:

```
/usr/src/app/linkedin/posted/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>/
```

Where `<slug>` is a 3-5 word kebab-case summary of the post (e.g. `hive-mind-is-back`, `ada-voice-intro`). Use today's date.

Copy the markdown file and any image/video that was attached into that folder. Do not delete the originals until the copy succeeds. Then delete the originals from the LinkedIn root.
