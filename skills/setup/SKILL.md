# setup

Master setup wizard. Run `/setup all` for full onboarding or `/setup <component>` for a specific step.

## Step 0 — Where and what kind of install?

**These are the first two questions. Ask them before anything else.**

### Question 1 — Local or Remote?

```
Where do you want to install Hive Mind?

(A) This machine  — you are already on the target host
(B) Remote machine — install on another machine via SSH
```

**If (B) Remote:** collect the target machine's host, SSH port (default 22), and username.
Then open a remote-admin session:

```bash
TOKEN=$(python3 -m keyring get hive-mind remote_admin_token)
PKEY=$(python3 -m keyring get hive-mind remote_admin_ssh_key_default)
SID=$(curl -s -X POST http://hive-mind-remote-admin:8430/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"host\":\"<host>\",\"port\":22,\"username\":\"<user>\",\"private_key\":\"$PKEY\"}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['session_id'])")
```

All remaining questions and setup steps (including Question 2 below) apply to the remote
machine and are executed via `exec` calls on that session. Relay each question and answer
through the session exactly as you would locally.

### Question 2 — What kind of install?

```
What kind of Hive Mind install is this?

(A) First instance — full install. Gateway, broker, Neo4j, minds, communication
    surfaces — everything. This becomes your primary Hub. Choose this for any
    new setup.

(B) Federated second instance — this machine gets its own full stack (gateway,
    broker, Neo4j). Completely independent, but minds here can communicate with
    minds on other instances via broker federation. When you get to the Minds
    step you can install new minds locally OR register a mind from another
    instance (no local install — just broker registration so they can message
    each other).

(C) Hub-spoke (managed) — a single mind on this machine, managed and routed
    by an existing Hive Mind instance. That instance handles routing, memory,
    and orchestration. No local gateway or broker needed.
```

Store as `INSTALL_TYPE` (values: `first`, `federated`, `spoke`).

- **first**: run every step below in full.
- **federated**: run every step below in full; at the Minds step, offer local install
  AND cross-instance broker registration as options.
- **spoke**: skip Nervous System and Neo4j; go straight to Config → Auth → Provider →
  Mind (single mind only), then configure the connection back to the managing Hub.

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

`$ARGUMENTS[0]` = optional component name.
Valid: `prerequisites`, `config`, `auth`, `nervous-system`, `provider`, `body`, `mind`, `all`
Default (no argument): show the menu.

## Step 2 — Show menu with quick health scan

```bash
gw=$(curl -sf http://localhost:8420/sessions > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "UP" || echo "DOWN")
neo=$(curl -sf http://localhost:7474 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "UP" || echo "DOWN")
dk=$(docker info > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "UP" || echo "DOWN")
minds=$(curl -sf http://localhost:8420/broker/minds 2>/dev/null | jq length 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
```

```
Hive Mind Setup
===============

Quick scan: Gateway [$gw]  Neo4j [$neo]  Docker [$dk]  Minds [$minds]

1. Prerequisites     — hardware, OS, Docker, Git         [not checked]
2. Configuration     — config.yaml, .env, compose profile [not generated]
3. Authentication    — Claude Code auth tokens            [not configured]
4. Nervous System    — gateway, broker, Neo4j, MCP        [$gw]
5. Providers         — Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama          [check config]
6. Body              — surfaces, integrations, services   [check containers]
7. Minds             — AI minds                           [$minds registered]

Run all:  /setup all
Run one:  /setup <component>
```

## Step 3 — Run selected components in dependency order

If `all`, run in this order (each completes before the next):
1. `/setup-prerequisites`
2. `/setup-config`
3. `/setup-auth`
4. `/setup-nervous-system`
5. `/setup-provider`
6. `/setup-body`
7. `/setup-resolve-placeholders`
8. `/setup-mind`

If a specific component, run just that sub-skill.

## Step 4 — Final report

After all requested components complete:

```
Setup Complete
==============

| Component       | Result       |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Prerequisites   | OK / ISSUES  |
| Configuration   | OK / ISSUES  |
| Authentication  | OK / ISSUES  |
| Nervous System  | OK / ISSUES  |
| Providers       | OK / ISSUES  |
| Body            | OK / ISSUES  |
| Minds           | OK / ISSUES  |

Next steps: <any outstanding issues or recommendations>

Skills installed:
  Core (auto): Identity pipeline, utilities — installed on all minds
  Optional:    <list groups selected during setup-mind, or "none selected">

Run `/setup-mind` to add or change skills for any mind.
See `MIND-INSTALL-MANIFEST.md` for the full skill catalog.
